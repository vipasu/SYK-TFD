* Protocol
- Start with TFD(beta=0) some product state; ground state of joint hamiltonian?
- time evolve by average of H_A and H_B and then the joint hamiltonian
- measure the cost function: fidelity? Free energy?
- gradient descent on the cost

* Questions
- Starting state?
- exponentials of pauli operators on cirq
- fidelity with respect to the TFD and i'm assuming you have already diagonalized the hamiltonian? What about the free energy measurement?
- what is the hamiltonian for which this is the ground state
